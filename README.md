🚨 Local Disaster Alert & Resource Coordination Platform

📌 Overview

The Local Disaster Alert & Resource Coordination Platform is a full-stack MERN web application designed to enhance communication, coordination, and response efficiency during natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, cyclones, and fires.

This platform provides a centralized system where citizens can report incidents and request essential resources, volunteers can respond to emergencies, and administrators can monitor and manage relief operations in real-time. The system aims to reduce response delays and improve disaster management efficiency.
